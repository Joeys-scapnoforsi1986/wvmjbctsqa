OMG, just finished watching The Ballad of Wallis Island and seriously, what the heck was that?! I mean, the story is all over the place, like one minute you’re totally vibing with Bob and then BAM, he just kicks the bucket. And don’t even get me started on the whole seagull subplot, like, why?! These birds get more screen time than the main characters—c’mon now.

Okay, so there’s this scene where Jill just decides to build a raft out of driftwood and like, zero survival skills, and my brain’s just thinking, “Girl, have you never seen a storm in your life?” Though I gotta admit, I kinda love how she keeps yelling at those fish. 😂 Anyway, before I forget, I had to download the movie 'cause it wasn’t streaming anywhere. Worth it? Questionable.

> So, there’s this part where the villagers start singing, and I swear, it was like a musical out of nowhere. I mean, who knew Roger could hit those notes? And the old lady with the tambourine, MVP if you ask me. But then five minutes later I’m like, “Nah, Roger’s definitely faking it.” And poof, my Spotify’s got a new song on repeat.

And let’s talk about that mysterious fisherman who’s like there but also not? Felt like a fever dream whenever he was on. Every time he’d give that cryptic advice, I’d just nod along like I understood any of it, though maybe I was just hypnotized by that gnarly beard. But hey, his dog was a pretty good sidekick. Made me think, should I get a dog? You know, just not a weirdo fishing one.

Don't even know where I was going with all of that, but yeah, Jill and the gang go from singing sailors to pirate wannabes and I’m like, “when did we switch genres?”😂 Not gonna lie, the graphics were dope! Watch the movie with some popcorn and it’s a crazy trip. Like the time we binged that awful cooking show, remember? Same vibes.

int main() {return 0;} // like, why am I channeling my inner programmer? My brain’s weird sometimes.

Alright, gotta crash now. Movie nights are exhausting, haha. Hit me up if you wanna rant about it, would love to know if I’m just losing my mind over it all!
